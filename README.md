a quick utility i wrote to learn py2app and practice w a couple of python things.

intended to be a GUI tool for designers to check how robust their designs would be when used in orb feature detection.

* install pipenv for python 3.7
* pipenv install for dependencies
* `pipenv run python setup.py py2app -A` for alias .app
